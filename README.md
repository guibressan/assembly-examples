* Why?

- Doesn't matter if you use C, C++, Rust, Go or other compiled languages,
in the end all these languages are just a way to organize logic that
will be optimized and translated to Assembly of the target CPU.

- Once you learn assembly, you will see every compiled binary
as file with source code. It's possible to execute binaries with GDB / LLDB
and start debugging code even when you don't have the source code.

- This repository contains a few code examples that I'm using for
knowledge fixation purposes.
